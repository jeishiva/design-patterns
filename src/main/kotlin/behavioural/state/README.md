# üß† State Pattern

## **Pattern Type:** Behavioral

## üß≠ The Origin ‚Äì Robotic Surgery Requires Step-by-Step Precision

Imagine we‚Äôre building a **robotic AI system for surgery**. Each surgical operation must follow a **strictly ordered procedure**:

1. Scan the target region
2. Sterilize the area
3. Perform incision
4. Repair or remove tissue
5. Suture the incision
6. Finalize and disengage tools

‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping or executing steps out of order could result in **serious medical complications**. That‚Äôs why the robot must **always know its current state**, and only allow valid next actions.

This is exactly where the **State Pattern** shines.

## üß© The Problem It Solves

> ‚ùì How do you manage an object whose behavior must change based on its internal state ‚Äî in a strict, safe, and extensible way?

The **State Pattern** lets you:

- Represent each state as a dedicated class
- Avoid complex `if-else` or `switch` branching logic
- Make state transitions explicit and safe
- Protect your system from invalid or premature actions

## üí° Real-World Applications

1. **AI Robotic Surgery**  
   Ensures the system transitions safely from scan ‚Üí incision ‚Üí suture in a controlled, testable way.

2. **Payment Flow Systems**  
   A transaction may be in `MethodSelected`, `Processing`, `Completed`, or `Aborted` state ‚Äî each with its own allowed actions.

3. **Android Memory Lifecycle**  
   Apps go through states like `Foreground`, `Background`, `LowMemoryWarning`, `Killed`. The OS must trigger behaviors based on these.

4. **Game AI or Scenes**  
   Players or NPCs may be in `Idle`, `Attacking`, `Healing`, or `Dead` states ‚Äî with different allowed transitions and logic.
