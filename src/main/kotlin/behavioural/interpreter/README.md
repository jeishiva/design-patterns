## 📖 The Origin Story

Imagine a world where Neuralink connects directly to the human brain. Every thought, gesture, or intent is transmitted as **electrical signals** — a raw, unstructured language. But how does a machine know what these signals mean?

This is where interpretation becomes vital.  
Neuralink needs a system that can **understand and interpret structured signals** into **meaningful commands** like:

- “Move the arm”
- “Speak this word”
- “Scroll the phone”

This mirrors exactly what the **Interpreter Pattern** does — defining a language and interpreting sentences made from it.

## ✅ What Problem Does It Solve?

We often have:
- A mini language or protocol (signals, formulas, scripts, etc.)
- A need to parse and act on it dynamically

Interpreter helps define a **grammar** and **rules for evaluating expressions**, separating intent from execution.

## 💡 Top Use Cases

1. **Neural Interfaces** – decoding brain signals
2. **Scripting Engines** – for game AI or automation rules
3. **Expression Evaluators** – for spreadsheets or config languages
4. **Command Parsers** – CLI, chatbot inputs, DSLs
5. **Behavioral triggers in games** – "if near enemy and low health then flee"

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy: Neuralink Signal Interpreter

- The **brain** emits raw signals (like "ARM_SIGNAL + SPEECH_SIGNAL")
- Each signal type has a specific **expression evaluator**
- The system checks each **interpreter** to determine what the user wants to do
- **CompositeInterpreter** helps interpret multiple signals at once

You don’t want the system to hard-code each possibility — instead, define **modular expressions** that can be composed, reused, and scaled.

## 🤔 When Not to Use
- When performance is critical, and you need to parse thousands of expressions quickly — Interpreter Pattern can be slow and memory heavy.
