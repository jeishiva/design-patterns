# 🔗 Chain of Responsibility Pattern

## 🧩 Pattern Type : Behavioral

---

## 📖 The Origin Story

You're building an app, and the CTO drops by with a directive:

> “Defer all non-functional logic — like crash logging, security checks, analytics — to a separate SDK. Let the core application stay clean.”

Instead of scattering SDK calls everywhere, you want a system where:

- The request goes into the SDK
- Each component decides if it wants to handle it
- The app does not care *who* handled what

This is the perfect moment for the **Chain of Responsibility** pattern.

---

## ✅ What Problem Does It Solve?

When multiple handlers may act on a request — but you don’t want tight coupling or hard-coded logic — Chain of Responsibility:

- **Decouples sender from receivers**
- Allows **multiple handlers to process (or skip)** a request
- Keeps your system **extensible**: add/remove handlers without touching the app code

---

## 📱 Real-World Example: App-to-SDK Delegation

In your application, you defer tasks like:

- 🔐 **Security checks**
- 📊 **Analytics uploads**
- 🐞 **Crash logging**

These responsibilities are handled by **chained SDK handlers**.  
The app just sends a request to the head of the chain, and each handler checks:

> “Is this request for me?”

If not, it passes it along. This way, the application is not tied to *who* performs the task.

---

## ⚠️ Design Consideration

Chain of Responsibility is most powerful as a **unidirectional, fire-and-forget** mechanism.

- ✅ Use it when the sender doesn’t need a response
- ❌ Avoid forcing back a response through the chain — it muddies separation of concerns
