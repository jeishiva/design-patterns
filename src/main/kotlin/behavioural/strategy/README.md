## üß≠ The Origin ‚Äì Adapting Behavior Without Changing the Core

You're building an e-commerce platform, and your pricing strategy depends on the **type of customer**:

- üéØ **New customers** should be acquired at any cost ‚Äî even if it means zero margin ‚Äî just to let them experience your product and service.
- üõí **Returning customers** should be charged the regular price with healthy margins.

Rather than cluttering your code with `if-else` logic, you want a **flexible way to plug in different pricing strategies** at runtime.

That‚Äôs where the **Strategy Pattern** steps in.
