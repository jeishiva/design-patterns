# üåâ Bridge Pattern

### **Pattern Type:** Structural

## üß≠ The Origin ‚Äì Scaling SEO Tracking in the LLM Era

As the AI search space evolves, companies want to know:

- "Is my product mentioned in ChatGPT results?"
- "How often does Gemini reference my brand?"
- "What‚Äôs my visibility score across Claude or DeepSeek?"

You start with a simple solution that queries one LLM. But soon, you need to:

- Support **multiple LLMs** (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, etc.)
- Track **different aspects** like product mentions, sentiment, and visibility

You don‚Äôt want to duplicate logic or create a messy web of conditionals.

This is where the **Bridge Pattern** helps ‚Äî by **decoupling the abstraction (what you track)** from the **implementation (where you track it)**.

## üß© The Problem It Solves

How do you build systems where **abstractions and implementations can evolve independently**?

Bridge Pattern allows:
- Adding **new LLMs** without changing your tracking logic
- Adding **new tracking strategies** (visibility, sentiment, etc.) without touching LLM integrations
- Clean separation of responsibilities and easy scaling

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Applications

1. **AI SEO Platforms**  
   Track product visibility or brand sentiment across multiple LLMs without tightly coupling logic to a specific provider.

2. **Payment Gateways**  
   Decouple transaction flows from the underlying processors (Razorpay, Stripe, PayPal).

3. **Media Streaming**  
   Separate video player UI from underlying rendering engines (ExoPlayer, AVPlayer, VLC).

4. **Cloud Deployment Managers**  
   Deploy containers while switching between AWS, GCP, Azure without changing core orchestration logic.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When Not to Use

- When the abstraction or implementation is unlikely to change or grow
- If inheritance is enough and doesn‚Äôt compromise maintainability
- When the bridge adds unnecessary layers without payoff

## üí° Key Concepts

| Role                    | Class/Interface               | Description                                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Abstraction`           | `SEOTracker`                  | Defines the tracking operation               |
| `Refined Abstraction`   | `ProductVisibilityTracker`    | Specific tracker behavior                    |
| `Implementor`           | `LLMIntegration`              | Interface for querying an LLM                |
| `Concrete Implementor`  | `ChatGPTIntegration`, `GeminiIntegration` | LLM-specific logic                |
