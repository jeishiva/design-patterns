# ðŸ§© Proxy Pattern

### **Pattern Type:** Structural

---

## ðŸ“– Origin Story â€“ A Layer of Protection

In an ancient kingdom, the royal **treasure vault** must never be accessed directly â€” or it risks being stolen. So, the king installs a **guardian system** that checks every request before forwarding it to the vault. Only verified people may enter.

These are classic use cases of the **Proxy Pattern** â€” where an object controls access to another object.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Core Problem It Solves

How do you **control or extend access** to a sensitive or complex object without changing it?

The Proxy Pattern provides a **stand-in or wrapper** around a real object, and intercepts calls to:
- Perform security checks
- Add caching
- Log usage or performance
- Delay resource-intensive operations

## ðŸ’¡ Real world Applications

1. **Trading & Financial Platforms**  
   Control access to sensitive operations like placing trades, viewing account balances, or executing crypto transactions by using a proxy that enforces authentication, authorization, or rate limits â€” ensuring only verified users or services can interact with the core trading engine.

2. **Access Control in Enterprise Apps**  
   Role-based access (RBAC) can use proxies to prevent unauthorized use of resources like payroll or financial data.

3. **Network Request Logging or Throttling**  
   A proxy adds logging, rate-limiting, or retry logic around an API client without touching the original network class.

## ðŸš« When Not to Use This Pattern

- If there's no added benefit in wrapping the object (no access control, delay, caching), a proxy adds unnecessary indirection.
- Take care not to let proxies become overloaded with logic â€” they should remain focused on access mediation or infrastructure concerns, not core business behavior.
