# ðŸ§© Abstract Factory Pattern

## **Pattern Type:** Creational

## ðŸ“– Origin Story â€“ Why This Pattern Was Born

In a first-person shooter game, players jump between wildly different time periods:
- In the **Medieval era**, they wield swords and shields.
- In the **Modern era**, they use guns and grenades.
- In the **Futuristic era**, they blast enemies with laser rifles and energy shields.

Each era requires a set of weapons that work together â€” you can't pair a plasma gun with a wooden shield!  
This challenge inspired the **Abstract Factory Pattern**, which helps construct **families of related objects** without mixing types or hardcoding class creation.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Core Problem It Solves

How do you create a group of related objects (like weapons and shields) without tying your code to specific classes?

The Abstract Factory Pattern solves this by:
- Encapsulating creation of **compatible object families**
- Using interfaces to hide concrete implementations
- Delegating the instantiation logic to a sealed class via `create()`, avoiding conditionals

## ðŸ’¡ Real World Applications

1. **Racing Game: Vehicle Customization Kits**  
   Generates families of compatible vehicle components (e.g., engine, transmission, brakes) based on car type:
   -  Muscle: V8 engine + manual gearbox
   -  Sports: Turbo engine + dual-clutch
2. **Cross-Platform UI Toolkits**  
   Builds matching UI components (buttons, checkboxes, toolbars) based on platform (e.g., Android, iOS, Web).

## ðŸš« When Not to Use This Pattern

- If you only need to create one type of object, the **Factory Pattern** may be more appropriate.
- If the "families" donâ€™t share consistent interfaces, abstract factories can become hard to maintain.
