# ðŸ§© Singleton Pattern

## **Pattern Type:** Creational

---

## ðŸ“– Origin Story â€“ Why This Pattern Was Born

Imagine youâ€™re setting up an **analytics engine** in a mobile app. You only want one instance of it collecting events, managing queues, and dispatching data throughout the appâ€™s lifetime. Creating multiple instances would mean duplicated data, race conditions, and chaos.

This need â€” to **create an object once and reuse it globally across the system** â€” gave birth to the **Singleton** pattern.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Core Problem It Solves

How do you ensure that only **one instance of a class exists**, with **global access**, and **controlled lifecycle management**?

Singleton provides a clean solution when:
- You need **shared state or coordination** across the app
- The object is **costly to create or must persist** across system boundaries
- You want to enforce a **single point of control**

## ðŸ’¡ Real-World Applications

1. **Analytics Engine Instance**  
   Ensures a single event collector is initialized and used app-wide.

2. **Application Object (Android / iOS)**  
   Provides a centralized context that lives throughout the app lifecycle.

3. **Configuration or Settings Manager**  
   Stores and provides access to global config like feature flags, themes, or environment info.

## ðŸš« When Not to Use This Pattern

- **Avoid if global access isnâ€™t essential.**  
  Singleton instances live for the entire application lifecycle. Using them for short-lived or modular logic can lead to **unnecessary memory retention** and **tight coupling**.

- **Makes unit testing harder.**  
  Singletons introduce hidden dependencies, making test setup and mocking difficult unless designed carefully (e.g., using interfaces or dependency injection).
